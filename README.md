# Hacker News Search App for RTS Labs:

Following the guidelines a made a simple app with a file structure similar to that of a larger application with a store utilizing multiple reducers and a larger state object.

There are 2 pages as instructed. The first is a Search page with a search form that lists up to 20 titles that match your search query. The second page is a History page that lists your search query history and allows you to click on each search query to get the same 20 titles.

Thank You for the Opportunity!

## Guidelines:

Using the Javascript framework of your choice, build an application that has two pages users can navigate to:

“/search” lets the user search the Hacker News Algolia API and displays a list of results (<https://hn.algolia.com/api>)

“/history” shows the users a list of their past searches from this session (these do not need to persist through refresh).

We're looking to see what you know in Javascript, querying an API, and state management. We're interested in whether you can write clean code and have the ability to learn/understand new technologies. We don't care about design/UI (for this project).
